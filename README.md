Some small projects to show the working of OpenCV library functions

I have made some basic projects to depict the working of OpenCV library functions.
The major project is my face recognizer using some images of artists as data in order to train my model...
I have used HAAR cascade classifier and HAAR face recognizer to deploy this model.
